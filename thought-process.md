When deploying, container orchestration can be done using Kubernetes for scaling the service behind a load balancer. The load balancer can be set up using Google Cloud Console and GKE can be used.

Future Scope: A CDN or caching layer can be added for requests with repeated Ids. The caching can be made specific to query parameters. If ‘id’ and ‘endpoint’ are repeated, then the same response can be used.
